# uncc_bussing

## Setup

Running this program is... a little complicated at the moment.
Python is required, as it is written in python.
Past that you will need the following libraries:

**tkintermapview**

**pillow**

Optional for other included code:

**numpy**

**pandas**

**matplotlib**

These can be installed with the following commands:

```
pip install tkintermapview
pip install pillow
pip install numpy
pip install pandas
pip install matplotlib
```

Currently we are investigating how to have all these installed when installing our app, but for now this is necessary.

## Running the Code

Running the code is as simple as running *Main Project/UNCCBussing.py*.
Optionally to test other code, you can investigate and run code in *Main Project/Graphing.py*.

## Instructions

Click and drag to move around the map, Scroll in and out to zoom, Click on a pin to see the associated graph, and click the pin again to close the graph.
