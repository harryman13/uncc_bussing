# uncc_bussing

## Setup

Running this program is... a little complicated at the moment.
Python is required, as it is written in python.
Past that you will need the following libraries:

**tkintermapview**

**pillow**

**pandas**

**customtkinter**

Optional libraries for other files:

**numpy**

**matplotlib**

These can be installed with the following commands:

```
pip install tkintermapview
pip install pillow
pip install numpy
pip install pandas
pip install matplotlib
pip install customtkinter
```

Currently we are investigating how to have all these installed when installing our app, but for now this is necessary.

## Running the Code

Running the code is as simple as running *Main Project/UNCCBussing.py*.
Optionally to test other code, you can investigate and run code in *Main Project/Graphing.py*.

## Instructions

Click and drag to move around the map, Scroll in and out to zoom, Click on a pin to see the associated graph, and click the pin again to close the graph.

You can toggle between looking at the Embarking vs Disembarking data using the button on the left.

Thanks.
